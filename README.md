## LT CLI

LeetCode Trip comes with a built-in CLI which can be used to generate template markdown files and do statistical analysis from the command line. While you can install LT CLI globally on your machine, you can run the following command. If you would like not to install it globally, you can use `yarn generator` and `yarn statistics` instead.

- `lt-cli create`: To generate template markdown files.

- `lt-cli statistics` To do statistical analysis.
