## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript with explanations. The algorithm questions include, but are not limited to LeetCode, _Coding Interviews: Questions, Analysis and Solutions_ and _Algorithms, 4th Edition_. Visit [LeetCode Trip](https://algorithm.yanceyleo.com/) for more information. The website is powered by [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## lt-cli

LeetCode Trip comes with a built-in CLI which can be used to generate template markdown files and do statistical analysis from the command line. While you can install lt-cli globally on your machine, you can run the following command.

- `lt-cli create`: To generate template markdown files.

- `lt-cli statistics`: To do statistical analysis.

If you would like not to install it globally, use `yarn generator` and `yarn statistics` instead.
